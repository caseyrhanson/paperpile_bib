              existing software LD Score Regression (LDSC) is that SumHer
              allows the user to specify the heritability model. We apply
              SumHer to results from 24 large-scale association studies
              (average sample size 121,000) using our recommended heritability
              model. We show that these studies tended to substantially
              over-correct for confounding, and as a result the number of
              genome-wide significant loci was under-reported by about a
              quarter. We also estimate enrichments for 24 categories of SNPs
              defined by functional annotations. A previous study using LDSC
              reported that conserved regions were 13-fold enriched, and found
              a further six categories with above threefold enrichment. By
              contrast, our analysis using SumHer finds that none of the
              categories have enrichment above twofold. SumHer provides an
              improved understanding of the genetic architecture of complex

              methylation microarray studies",
  author   = "Zindler, Tristan and Frieling, Helge and Neyazi, Alexandra and

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Systematic technical effects-also called batch
              effects-are a considerable challenge when analyzing DNA
              methylation (DNAm) microarray data, because they can lead to
              false results when confounded with the variable of interest.
              Methods to correct these batch effects are error-prone, as
              previous findings have shown. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate how
              using the R function ComBat to correct simulated Infinium
              HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450 K) and Infinium MethylationEPIC
              BeadChip Kit (EPIC) DNAm data can lead to a large number of false
              positive results under certain conditions. We further provide a
              detailed assessment of the consequences for the highly relevant
              problem of p-value inflation with subsequent false positive
              findings after application of the frequently used ComBat method.
              Using ComBat to correct for batch effects in randomly generated
              samples produced alarming numbers of false discovery rate (FDR)
              and Bonferroni-corrected (BF) false positive results in
              unbalanced as well as in balanced sample distributions in terms
              of the relation between the outcome of interest variable and the
              technical position of the sample during the probe measurement.
              Both sample size and number of batch factors (e.g. number of
              chips) were systematically simulated to assess the probability of
              false positive findings. The effect of sample size was simulated
              using n = 48 up to n = 768 randomly generated samples. Increasing
              the number of corrected factors led to an exponential increase in
              the number of false positive signals. Increasing the number of
              samples reduced, but did not completely prevent, this effect.
              CONCLUSIONS: Using the approach described, we demonstrate, that
              using ComBat for batch correction in DNAm data can lead to false
              positive results under certain conditions and sample
              distributions. Our results are thus contrary to previous
              publications, considering a balanced sample distribution as
              unproblematic when using ComBat. We do not claim completeness in
              terms of reporting all technical conditions and possible
              solutions of the occurring problems as we approach the problem
              from a clinician's perspective and not from that of a computer
              scientist. With our approach of simulating data, we provide
              readers with a simple method to assess the probability of false
              positive findings in DNAm microarray data analysis pipelines.",

              ``treatment'' and batch effects to a real gene expression
              dataset. The performances of LMM and Combat, with and without
              quality control samples, are assessed in terms of sensitivity and

              systematic technical variation. Confounding of experimental
              batches with the variable(s) of interest is especially
              concerning, as a batch effect may then be interpreted as a
              biologically significant finding. An integral step toward
              reducing false discovery in molecular data analysis includes
              inspection for batch effects and accounting for this signal if
              present. In a 30-sample pilot Illumina Infinium
              HumanMethylation450 (450k array) experiment, we identified two
              sources of batch effects: row and chip. Here, we demonstrate two
              approaches taken to process the 450k data in which an R function,
              ComBat, was applied to adjust for the non-biological signal. In
              the ``initial analysis,'' the application of ComBat to an
              unbalanced study design resulted in 9,612 and 19,214 significant
              (FDR < 0.05) DNA methylation differences, despite none present

              as a greater number of samples, and successfully reduced batch
              effects without introducing false signal. Our work supports
              conclusions made by an article previously published in this
              journal: though the ultimate antidote to batch effects is
              thoughtful study design, every DNA methylation microarray
              analysis should inspect, assess and, if necessary, account for
              batch effects. The analysis experience presented here can serve
              as a reminder to the broader community to establish research

              Several strategies have been proposed for the removal of batch
              effects, although they have not been evaluated in large-scale
              longitudinal gene expression data. In this study, we aimed at
              identifying a suitable method for batch effect removal in a large
              study of microarray-based longitudinal gene expression. Monocytic
              gene expression was measured in 1092 participants of the
              Gutenberg Health Study at baseline and 5-year follow up.
              Replicates of selected samples were measured at both time points
              to identify technical variability. Deming regression,
              Passing-Bablok regression, linear mixed models, non-linear models
              as well as ReplicateRUV and ComBat were applied to eliminate
              batch effects between replicates. In a second step, quantile
              normalization prior to batch effect correction was performed for

              principal component analysis. Associations between body mass
              index and transcriptomes were calculated before and after batch
              removal. Results from association analyses were compared to
              evaluate maintenance of biological variability. Quantile
              normalization, separately performed in each batch, combined with
              ComBat successfully reduced batch effects and maintained

              all samples. All other methods did not substantially reduce batch
              effects in the replicate data subset. Quantile normalization plus

              heterogeneity is commonly observed across multiple batches of
              data that are generated from different processing or reagent
              batches, experimenters, protocols, or profiling platforms. These
              so-called batch effects often confound true biological
              relationships in the data, reducing the power benefits of
              combining multiple batches, and may even lead to spurious results

              contribute multiple methods and software tools for improved
              combination and analysis of data from multiple batches. In

               resources is hampered by technical artifacts and inherent
               biological heterogeneity. The former are usually termed ?batch
               effects,? and the latter is often modeled by subtypes. Existing
               methods either tackle batch effects provided that subtypes are
               known or cluster subtypes assuming that batch effects are
               absent. Consequently, there is a lack of research on the
               correction of batch effects with the presence of unknown
               subtypes. Here, we combine a location-and-scale adjustment model
               and model-based clustering into a novel hybrid one, the
               batch-effects-correction-with-unknown-subtypes model (BUS). BUS
               is capable of (a) correcting batch effects explicitly, (b)
               grouping samples that share similar characteristics into
               subtypes, (c) identifying features that distinguish subtypes,
               (d) allowing the number of subtypes to vary from batch to batch,
               (e) integrating batches from different platforms, and (f)
               enjoying a linear-order computation complexity. We prove the
               identifiability of BUS and provide conditions for study designs
               under which batch effects can be corrected. BUS is evaluated by
               simulation studies and a real breast cancer dataset combined

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Co-inertia analysis (CIA) is a multivariate
              statistical analysis method that can assess relationships and
              trends in two sets of data. Recently CIA has been used for an
              integrative analysis of multiple high-dimensional omics data.
              However, for classical CIA, all elements in the loading vectors
              are nonzero, presenting a challenge for the interpretation when
              analyzing omics data. For other multivariate statistical methods
              such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA), penalized least
              squares (PLS), various approaches have been proposed to produce
              sparse loading vectors via l1-penalization/constraint. We propose
              a novel CIA method that uses l1-penalization to induce sparsity
              in estimators of loading vectors. Our method simultaneously
              conducts model fitting and variable selection. Also, we propose
              another CIA method that incorporates structure/network
              information such as those from functional genomics, besides using
              sparsity penalty so that one can get biologically meaningful and
              interpretable results. RESULTS: Extensive simulations demonstrate
              that our proposed penalized CIA methods achieve the best or close
              to the best performance compared to the existing CIA method in
              terms of feature selection and recovery of true loading vectors.
              Also, we apply our methods to the integrative analysis of gene
              expression data and protein abundance data from the NCI-60 cancer
              cell lines. Our analysis of the NCI-60 cancer cell line data
              reveals meaningful variables for cancer diseases and biologically
              meaningful results that are consistent with previous studies.

              between the different biological entities. These graphical
              outputs include Correlation Circle plots, Relevance Networks and
              Clustered Image Maps. We demonstrate the usefulness of such
              graphical outputs on several biological data sets and further
              assess their biological relevance using gene ontology analysis.
              CONCLUSIONS: Such graphical outputs are undoubtedly useful to aid
              the interpretation of these promising integrative analysis tools
              and will certainly help in addressing fundamental biological
              questions and understanding systems as a whole. AVAILABILITY: The

  abstract = "We compare methods for filtering RNA-seq lowexpression genes and
              investigate the effect of filtering on detection of
              differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Although RNA-seq
              technology has improved the dynamic range of gene expression
              quantification, low-expression genes may be indistinguishable
              from sampling noise. The presence of noisy, low-expression genes
              can decrease the sensitivity of detecting DEGs. Thus,
              identification and filtering of these low-expression genes may
              improve DEG detection sensitivity. Using the SEQC benchmark
              dataset, we investigate the effect of different filtering methods
              on DEG detection sensitivity. Moreover, we investigate the effect
              of RNA-seq pipelines on optimal filtering thresholds. Results
              indicate that the filtering threshold that maximizes the total
              number of DEGs closely corresponds to the threshold that
              maximizes DEG detection sensitivity. Transcriptome reference

              high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data analysis. Although
              there are numerous methods for read count normalization, it
              remains a challenge to choose an optimal method due to multiple
              factors contributing to read count variability that affects the
              overall sensitivity and specificity. In order to properly
              determine the most appropriate normalization methods, it is
              critical to compare the performance and shortcomings of a
              representative set of normalization routines based on different
              dataset characteristics. Therefore, we set out to evaluate the
              performance of the commonly used methods (DESeq, TMM-edgeR,
              FPKM-CuffDiff, TC, Med UQ and FQ) and two new methods we propose:
              Med-pgQ2 and UQ-pgQ2 (per-gene normalization after per-sample
              median or upper-quartile global scaling). Our per-gene
              normalization approach allows for comparisons between conditions
              based on similar count levels. Using the benchmark Microarray
              Quality Control Project (MAQC) and simulated datasets, we
              performed differential gene expression analysis to evaluate these
              methods. When evaluating MAQC2 with two replicates, we observed
              that Med-pgQ2 and UQ-pgQ2 achieved a slightly higher area under
              the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), a specificity
              rate > 85\%, the detection power > 92\% and an actual false
              discovery rate (FDR) under 0.06 given the nominal FDR
              ($\leq$0.05). Although the top commonly used methods (DESeq and
              TMM-edgeR) yield a higher power (>93\%) for MAQC2 data, they
              trade off with a reduced specificity (<70\%) and a slightly
              higher actual FDR than our proposed methods. In addition, the
              results from an analysis based on the qualitative characteristics
              of sample distribution for MAQC2 and human breast cancer datasets
              show that only our gene-wise normalization methods corrected data
              skewed towards lower read counts. However, when we evaluated
              MAQC3 with less variation in five replicates, all methods
              performed similarly. Thus, our proposed Med-pgQ2 and UQ-pgQ2
              methods perform slightly better for differential gene analysis of
              RNA-seq data skewed towards lowly expressed read counts with high
              variation by improving specificity while maintaining a good
              detection power with a control of the nominal FDR level.",

               Anatomical ontologies are used to map omics data across
               experiments and between an experiment and a particular
               visualization in a data-dependent manner. COMICS is built on top
               of several existing resources. Zebrafish and mouse anatomical
               ontologies with their controlled vocabulary (CV) and defined
               hierarchy are used with the ontoCAT R package to aggregate data
               for comparison and visualization. Libraries from the QGIS
               geographical information system are used with the R packages
               ``maps'' and ``maptools'' to visualize and interact with
               molecular expression data in anatomical drawings of the model
               systems. COMICS allows users to upload their own data from omics
               experiments, using any gene or protein nomenclature they wish,
               as long as CV terms are used to define anatomical regions or
               developmental stages. Common nomenclatures such as the ZFIN gene
               names and UniProt accessions are provided additional support.
               COMICS can be used to generate publication-quality
               visualizations of gene and protein expression across
               experiments. Unlike previous tools that have used anatomical
               ontologies to interpret imaging data in several animal models,

               resolved data generated by dissection or fractionation and
               display this data in visually clear anatomical representations
               rather than large data tables. COMICS is optimized for

              due to factors that are unknown, unmeasured, or too complicated

              441 transcription factor and signaling protein isoforms across 68
              Yoruba (YRI) HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and
              identified 12 cis and 160 trans protein level QTLs (pQTLs) at a
              false discovery rate (FDR) of 20\%. Whereas up to two thirds of
              cis mRNA expression QTLs (eQTLs) were also pQTLs, many pQTLs were
              not associated with mRNA expression. Notably, we replicated and
              functionally validated a trans pQTL relationship between the KARS
              lysyl-tRNA synthetase locus and levels of the DIDO1 protein. This
              study demonstrates proof of concept in applying an antibody-based
              microarray approach to iteratively measure the levels of human
              proteins and relate these levels to human genome variation and
              other genomic data sets. Our results suggest that protein-based
              mechanisms might functionally buffer genetic alterations that
              influence mRNA expression levels and that pQTLs might contribute
              phenotypic diversity to a human population independently of
              influences on mRNA expression.",

              observed in clinical practice. While the extent of genetic
              variability in classic pharmacokinetic genes is rather well
              understood, the role of genetic variation in drug targets is
              typically less studied. METHODS: Based on 60,706 human exomes
              from the ExAC dataset, we performed an in-depth computational
              analysis of the prevalence of functional variants in 806
              drug-related genes, including 628 known drug targets. We further
              computed the likelihood of 1236 FDA-approved drugs to be affected
              by functional variants in their targets in the whole ExAC
              population as well as different geographic sub-populations.
              RESULTS: We find that most genetic variants in drug-related genes
              are very rare (f < 0.1\%) and thus will likely not be observed in
              clinical trials. Furthermore, we show that patient risk varies
              for many drugs and with respect to geographic ancestry. A focused
              analysis of oncological drug targets indicates that the
              probability of a patient carrying germline variants in
              oncological drug targets is, at 44\%, high enough to suggest that
              not only somatic alterations but also germline variants carried
              over into the tumor genome could affect the response to
              antineoplastic agents. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that
              even though many variants are very rare and thus likely not
              observed in clinical trials, four in five patients are likely to
              carry a variant with possibly functional effects in a target for
              commonly prescribed drugs. Such variants could potentially alter
              drug efficacy.",

              personalized medicine, predicting the impact of single nucleotide
              polymorphisms (SNPs) in regulatory elements is an important goal.
              Current approaches to determine the potential of regulatory SNPs
              depend on inadequate knowledge of cell-specific DNA binding
              motifs. Here, we present Sasquatch, a new computational approach
              that uses DNase footprint data to estimate and visualize the
              effects of noncoding variants on transcription factor binding.
              Sasquatch performs a comprehensive k-mer-based analysis of DNase
              footprints to determine any k-mer's potential for protein binding
              in a specific cell type and how this may be changed by sequence
              variants. Therefore, Sasquatch uses an unbiased approach,
              independent of known transcription factor binding sites and
              motifs. Sasquatch only requires a single DNase-seq data set per
              cell type, from any genotype, and produces consistent predictions
              from data generated by different experimental procedures and at
              different sequence depths. Here we demonstrate the effectiveness
              of Sasquatch using previously validated functional SNPs and
              benchmark its performance against existing approaches. Sasquatch
              is available as a versatile webtool incorporating publicly

               being explored exhibits uncertainty. This has led to much work
               in understanding how to rank uncertain datasets in recent years.
               In this paper, we address the problem of ranking when the tuple
               scores are uncertain, and the uncertainty is captured using
               continuous probability distributions (e.g. Gaussian
               distributions). We present a comprehensive solution to compute
               the values of a parameterized ranking function (PRF) [18] for
               arbitrary continuous probability distributions (and thus rank
               the uncertain dataset); PRF can be used to simulate or
               approximate many other ranking functions proposed in prior work.
               We develop exact polynomial time algorithms for some continuous

               schemes with provable guarantees for arbitrary probability

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Pathway enrichment techniques are useful for
              understanding experimental metabolomics data. Their purpose is to
              give context to the affected metabolites in terms of the prior
              knowledge contained in metabolic pathways. However, the
              interpretation of a prioritized pathway list is still
              challenging, as pathways show overlap and cross talk effects.
              RESULTS: We introduce FELLA, an R package to perform a
              network-based enrichment of a list of affected metabolites. FELLA
              builds a hierarchical representation of an organism biochemistry
              from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG),
              containing pathways, modules, enzymes, reactions and metabolites.
              In addition to providing a list of pathways, FELLA reports
              intermediate entities (modules, enzymes, reactions) that link the
              input metabolites to them. This sheds light on pathway cross talk
              and potential enzymes or metabolites as targets for the condition
              under study. FELLA has been applied to six public datasets -three
              from Homo sapiens, two from Danio rerio and one from Mus
              musculus- and has reproduced findings from the original studies
              and from independent literature. CONCLUSIONS: The R package FELLA
              offers an innovative enrichment concept starting from a list of
              metabolites, based on a knowledge graph representation of the
              KEGG database that focuses on interpretability. Besides reporting
              a list of pathways, FELLA suggests intermediate entities that are
              of interest per se. Its usefulness has been shown at several
              molecular levels on six public datasets, including human and
              animal models. The user can run the enrichment analysis through a
              simple interactive graphical interface or programmatically. FELLA
              is publicly available in Bioconductor under the GPL-3 license.",

              intervention and treatment. Here we present novel machine
              learning frameworks for identifying common and rare
              disease-associated genetic variation, which outperform
              conventional approaches. By integrating single-cell multiomics
              profiling of human lungs to link genetic signals to
              cell-type-specific functions, we have discovered and validated
              over 1,000 risk genes underlying severe COVID-19 across 19 cell
              types. Identified risk genes are overexpressed in healthy lungs
              but relatively downregulated in severely diseased lungs. Genetic
              risk for severe COVID-19, within both common and rare variants,
              is particularly enriched in natural killer (NK) cells, which
              places these immune cells upstream in the pathogenesis of severe
              disease. Mendelian randomization indicates that failed
              NKG2D-mediated activation of NK cells leads to critical illness.
              Network analysis further links multiple pathways associated with
              NK cell activation, including type-I-interferon-mediated
              signalling, to severe COVID-19. Our rare variant model, PULSE,
              enables sensitive prediction of severe disease in non-elderly
              patients based on whole-exome sequencing; individualized
              predictions are accurate independent of age and sex, and are
              consistent across multiple populations and cohorts. Risk
              stratification based on exome sequencing has the potential to
              facilitate post-exposure prophylaxis in at-risk individuals,
              potentially based around augmentation of NK cell function.
              Overall, our study characterizes a comprehensive genetic
              landscape of COVID-19 severity and provides novel insights into
              the molecular mechanisms of severe disease, leading to new
              therapeutic targets and sensitive detection of at-risk

              demonstrate that DPEP1 functions as a positive regulator for
              colon cancer cell metastasis. The expression of DPEP1 mRNA and
              proteins were upregulated in colon cancer tissues compared to
              normal mucosa. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches
              were used to examine the malignant phenotype of DPEP1-expressing
              or DPEP1-depleted cells. DPEP1 expression caused a significant
              increase in colon cancer cell adhesion and invasion in vitro, and
              metastasis in vivo. In contrast, DPEP1 depletion induced opposite
              effects. Furthermore, cilastatin, a DPEP1 inhibitor, suppressed
              the invasion and metastasis of DPEP1-expressing cells. DPEP1
              inhibited the leukotriene D4 signaling pathway and increased the

               mining valid scientific discoveries from these abundant
               resources is hampered by technical artifacts and inherent
               biological heterogeneity. The former are usually termed ?batch
               effects,? and the latter is often modeled by subtypes. Existing
               methods either tackle batch effects provided that subtypes are
               known or cluster subtypes assuming that batch effects are
               absent. Consequently, there is a lack of research on the
               correction of batch effects with the presence of unknown
               subtypes. Here, we combine a location-and-scale adjustment model
               and model-based clustering into a novel hybrid one, the
               batch-effects-correction-with-unknown-subtypes model (BUS). BUS
               is capable of (a) correcting batch effects explicitly, (b)
               grouping samples that share similar characteristics into

               identifiability of BUS and provide conditions for study designs

               simulation studies and a real breast cancer dataset combined
               from three batches measured on two platforms. Results from the
               breast cancer dataset offer much better biological insights than

              quantitative method based on targeted proteomics analysis of
              plasma proteins using isotope-labeled recombinant standards
              originating from the Human Protein Atlas project has been
              established. The standards were individually quantified prior to
              being employed in the final multiplex assay. The assays are
              mainly directed toward actively secreted proteins produced in the
              liver, but may also originate from other parts of the human body.
              This study included 21 proteins classified by the FDA as either
              drug targets or approved clinical protein biomarkers. We describe
              the use of this multiplex assay for profiling a well-defined
              human cohort with sample collection spanning over a one-year
              period. Samples were collected at four different time points,

              disease remain poorly understood. Recently, a new analytical
              platform for comprehensive analysis of plasma protein profiles
              using proximity extension assays combined with next generation
              sequencing has been developed, which allows for multiple proteins
              to be analyzed simultaneously without sacrifice on accuracy or
              sensitivity. METHODS: We analyzed the plasma protein profiles of
              COVID-19 patients (n = 50) with mild and moderate symptoms by
              comparing the protein levels in newly diagnosed patients with the
              protein levels in the same individuals after 14 days. FINDINGS:
              The study has identified more than 200 proteins that are
              significantly elevated during infection and many of these are
              related to cytokine response and other immune-related functions.
              In addition, several other proteins are shown to be elevated,
              including SCARB2, a host cell receptor protein involved in virus
              entry. A comparison with the plasma protein response in patients
              with severe symptoms shows a highly similar pattern, but with
              some interesting differences. INTERPRETATION: The study presented
              here demonstrates the usefulness of ``next generation plasma
              protein profiling'' to identify molecular signatures of
              importance for disease progression and to allow monitoring of
              disease during recovery from the infection. The results will
              facilitate further studies to understand the molecular mechanism
              of the immune-related response of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. FUNDING:

              diabetes as well as the dynamics of protein patterns during
              changes in metabolic status. METHODS: To elucidate the systemic
              alterations in early-stage diabetes and to investigate the
              effects on the proteome during metabolic improvement, we measured
              974 circulating proteins in 52 newly diagnosed,
              treatment-na{\"\i}ve type 2 diabetes subjects at baseline and
              after 1 and 3 months of guideline-based diabetes treatment, while
              comparing their protein profiles to that of 94 subjects without
              diabetes. FINDINGS: Early stage type 2 diabetes was associated
              with distinct protein patterns, reflecting key metabolic syndrome
              features including insulin resistance, adiposity, hyperglycemia
              and liver steatosis. The protein profiles at baseline were
              attenuated during guideline-based diabetes treatment and several
              plasma proteins associated with metformin medication
              independently of metabolic variables, such as circulating EPCAM.
              INTERPRETATION: The results advance our knowledge about the
              biochemical manifestations of type 2 diabetes and suggest that
              comprehensive protein profiling may serve as a useful tool for

              potential mechanisms often reported emphasize the vital role of
