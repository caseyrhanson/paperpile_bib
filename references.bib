  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The transforming growth factor-$\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$)
              pathway plays a pivotal role in inducing epithelial-mesenchymal
              transition (EMT), which is a key step in cancer invasion and
              metastasis. However, the regulatory mechanism of TGF-$\beta$ in
              inducing EMT in colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been fully
              elucidated. In previous studies, it was found that S100A8 may
              regulate EMT. This study aimed to clarify the role of S100A8 in
              TGF-$\beta$-induced EMT and explore the underlying mechanism in
              CRC. METHODS: S100A8 and upstream transcription factor 2 (USF2)
              expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in 412 CRC
              tissues. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed. In vitro,
              Western blot, and migration and invasion assays were performed to
              investigate the effects of S100A8 and USF2 on TGF-$\beta$-induced
              EMT. Mouse metastasis models were used to determine in vivo
              metastasis ability. Luciferase reporter and chromatin
              immunoprecipitation assay were used to explore the role of USF2
              on S100A8 transcription. RESULTS: During TGF-$\beta$-induced EMT
              in CRC cells, S100A8 and the transcription factor USF2 were
              upregulated. S100A8 promoted cell migration and invasion and EMT.
              USF2 transcriptionally regulated S100A8 expression by directly
              binding to its promoter region. Furthermore, TGF-$\beta$ enhanced
              the USF2/S100A8 signaling axis of CRC cells whereas extracellular
              S100A8 inhibited the USF2/S100A8 axis of CRC cells. S100A8
              expression in tumor cells was associated with poor overall
              survival in CRC. USF2 expression was positively related to S100A8
              expression in tumor cells but negatively related to
              S100A8-positive stromal cells. CONCLUSIONS: TGF-$\beta$ was found
              to promote EMT and metastasis through the USF2/S100A8 axis in CRC
              while extracellular S100A8 suppressed the USF2/S100A8 axis. USF2
              was identified as an important switch on the intracellular and
              extracellular S100A8 feedback loop.",

              correlation is not the result of confounding with environmental
              variables that also affect the trait. In this study, we study the
              properties of linkage disequilibrium (LD) Score regression, a
              recently developed method for using summary statistics from
              genome-wide association studies to ensure that confounding does

              able to obtain results about the unbiasedness of this method. We
              demonstrate that LD Score regression can produce estimates of
              confounding at null SNPs that are unbiased or conservative under
              fairly general conditions. This robustness holds in the case of

              over SNPs between LD Scores and the degree of confounding.
              Additionally, we demonstrate that LD Score regression can produce

  abstract = "Consider the random vector (X, Y), where X is completely observed
              and Y is subject to random right censoring. It is well known that
              the completely nonparametric kernel estimator of the conditional
              distribution $$\{F(\textbackslashcdot|x)\}$$of Y given X = x
              suffers from inconsistency problems in the right tail (Beran
              1981, Technical Report, University of California, Berkeley), and
              hence any location function m(x) that involves the right tail of
              $$\{F(\textbackslashcdot|x)\}$$(like the conditional mean) cannot
              be estimated consistently in a completely nonparametric way. In
              this paper, we propose an alternative estimator of m(x), that,
              under certain conditions, does not share the above inconsistency
              problems. The estimator is constructed under the model Y = m(X) +
              $\sigma$(X)$\epsilon$, where
              $$\{\textbackslashsigma(\textbackslashcdot)\}$$is an unknown
              scale function and $\epsilon$ (with location zero and scale one)
              is independent of X. We obtain the asymptotic properties of the
              proposed estimator of m(x), we compare it with the completely

              collected more than 250,000 protein level measurements comprising
              441 transcription factor and signaling protein isoforms across 68
              Yoruba (YRI) HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and
              identified 12 cis and 160 trans protein level QTLs (pQTLs) at a

              cis mRNA expression QTLs (eQTLs) were also pQTLs, many pQTLs were

              form of cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related
              death in the world. Basic and clinical data indicate that aspirin
              and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may
              prevent colon cancer but mechanisms remain unknown. Aspirin
              metabolite salicylate and other NSAIDs may inhibit tumor cell
              growth acting on store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), suggesting an
              important role for this pathway in CRC. Consistently, SOCE is
              emerging as a novel player in different forms of cancer,
              including CRC. SOCE and store-operated currents (SOCs) are
              dramatically enhanced in CRC while Ca2+ stores are partially
              empty in CRC cells. These features may contribute to CRC
              hallmarks including enhanced cell proliferation, migration,
              invasion and survival. At the molecular level, enhanced SOCE and
              depleted stores are mediated by overexpression of Orai1, Stromal
              interaction protein 1 (STIM1) and Transient receptor protein
              channel 1 (TRPC1) and downregulation of STIM2. In normal colonic
              cells, SOCE is mediated by Ca2+-release activated Ca2+ channels
              made of STIM1, STIM2 and Orai1. In CRC cells, SOCE is mediated by
              different store-operated currents (SOCs) driven by STIM1, Orai1
              and TRPC1. Loss of STIM2 contributes to depletion of Ca2+ stores
              and enhanced resistance to cell death in CRC cells. Thus, SOCE is
              a novel key player in CRC and inhibition by salicylate and other
              NSAIDs may contribute to explain chemoprevention activity.
              SUMMARY: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most frequent form
              of cancer worldwide. Recent evidence suggests that intracellular
              Ca2+ remodeling may contribute to cancer hallmarks. In addition,
              aspirin and other NSAIDs might prevent CRC acting on remodeled
              Ca2+ entry pathways. In this review, we will briefly describe 1)
              the players involved in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis with a
              particular emphasis on the mechanisms involved in SOCE activation
              and inactivation, 2) the evidence that aspirin metabolite
              salicylate and other NSAIDs inhibits tumor cell growth acting on
              SOCE, 3) evidences on the remodeling of intracellular Ca2+ in
              cancer with a particular emphasis in SOCE, 4) the remodeling of
              SOCE and Ca2+ store content in CRC and, finally, 5) the molecular
              basis of Ca2+ remodeling in CRC. This article is part of a

              circulating protein patterns at the early stage of type 2
              diabetes as well as the dynamics of protein patterns during
              changes in metabolic status. METHODS: To elucidate the systemic
              alterations in early-stage diabetes and to investigate the
              effects on the proteome during metabolic improvement, we measured
              974 circulating proteins in 52 newly diagnosed,
              treatment-na{\"\i}ve type 2 diabetes subjects at baseline and
              after 1 and 3 months of guideline-based diabetes treatment, while
              comparing their protein profiles to that of 94 subjects without
              diabetes. FINDINGS: Early stage type 2 diabetes was associated
              with distinct protein patterns, reflecting key metabolic syndrome
              features including insulin resistance, adiposity, hyperglycemia
              and liver steatosis. The protein profiles at baseline were

              the cellular mechanisms underlying the various effects of the
              disease remain poorly understood. Recently, a new analytical
              platform for comprehensive analysis of plasma protein profiles
              using proximity extension assays combined with next generation
              sequencing has been developed, which allows for multiple proteins
              to be analyzed simultaneously without sacrifice on accuracy or
              sensitivity. METHODS: We analyzed the plasma protein profiles of
              COVID-19 patients (n = 50) with mild and moderate symptoms by
              comparing the protein levels in newly diagnosed patients with the
              protein levels in the same individuals after 14 days. FINDINGS:
              The study has identified more than 200 proteins that are
              significantly elevated during infection and many of these are
              related to cytokine response and other immune-related functions.
              In addition, several other proteins are shown to be elevated,
              including SCARB2, a host cell receptor protein involved in virus
              entry. A comparison with the plasma protein response in patients
              with severe symptoms shows a highly similar pattern, but with
              some interesting differences. INTERPRETATION: The study presented
              here demonstrates the usefulness of ``next generation plasma

              importance for disease progression and to allow monitoring of

  abstract = "UNLABELLED: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major cause of
              cancer related-death in developed countries. The mortality risk
              is correlated with the stage of CRC determined at the primary
              diagnosis and early diagnosis is associated with enhanced
              survival rate. Currently, only faecal occult blood tests are used
              to screen for CRC. Consequently, there is an incentive to
              identify specific markers of CRC. We used quantitative proteomic
              analysis of serum samples to characterize protein profiles in
              adenoma, CRC and healthy control samples. We identified 89
              distinct proteins modulated between normal, colorectal adenoma
              and carcinoma patients. This list emphasizes proteins involved in
              enzyme regulator activities and in particular the serpin family.
              In serum samples, protein profiles of three members of the serpin
              family (SERPINA1, SERPINA3 and SERPINC1) were confirmed by ELISA
              assays. We obtained sensitivity/specificity values of 95\%/95\%
              for both SERPINA1 and SERPINC1, and 95\%/55\% for SERPINA3. This
              study supports the idea that serum proteins can discriminate
              adenoma and CRC patients from unaffected patients and reveals a
              panel of regulated proteins that might be useful for selecting
              patients for colonoscopy. By evaluating SERPINA1, SERPINA3 and
              SERPINC1, we highlight the potential role of the serpin family
              during the development and progression of CRC. SIGNIFICANCE:
              Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major cause of cancer mortality
              throughout the world. However, very few CRC biomarkers have
              satisfactory sensitivity and specificity in clinical practice. To
              the best of our knowledge our study is the first to profile sera
              proteomes between adenoma, CRC and healthy patients. We report a
              comprehensive list of proteins that may be used as early
              diagnostic biomarkers of CRC. It is noteworthy that 17\% of these
              modulated proteins have been previously described as candidate
              biomarkers in CRC. Enzyme regulator activity was found to be the
              main molecular function among these proteins and, in particular,
              there was an enrichment of members of the serpin family. The
              subsequent verification on a new cohort by ELISA demonstrates
              that these serpins could be useful to discriminate healthy from
              colorectal carcinoma patients with a high sensitivity and
              specificity. The combination of these biomarkers should increase
              predictive powers of CRC diagnosis. The remaining candidates form
              a reserve for further evaluation of additional biomarkers for CRC
              diagnosis.",

              functions, and cell motility. In this system, phospholipase C
              (PLC) is a key enzyme, which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol
              4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P(2)) into two second messengers,
              inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P(3)) and diacylglycerol
              (DAG). Ins(1,4,5)P(3) triggers the release of calcium from
              intracellular stores, and DAG mediates the activation of protein
              kinase C (PKC). In parallel, PI(4,5)P(2) also directly regulates
              a variety of cellular functions, including cytoskeletal
              remodeling, cytokinesis, phagocytosis, membrane dynamics, and

              contributes to the pathogeneses of various human diseases.
              Therefore, strict regulation of the levels of PI(4,5)P(2) and

               visualization in a data-dependent manner. COMICS is built on top
               of several existing resources. Zebrafish and mouse anatomical
               ontologies with their controlled vocabulary (CV) and defined
               hierarchy are used with the ontoCAT R package to aggregate data
               for comparison and visualization. Libraries from the QGIS
               geographical information system are used with the R packages
               ``maps'' and ``maptools'' to visualize and interact with
               molecular expression data in anatomical drawings of the model
               systems. COMICS allows users to upload their own data from omics
               experiments, using any gene or protein nomenclature they wish,
               as long as CV terms are used to define anatomical regions or

              consumption of high-calorie diets. It remains unclear how much of
              an impact NASH and HF have on the development of liver metastasis
              in CRC. METHODS: Patients who underwent curative surgical
              resection for CRC between 2000 and 2011 were included in this
              study. We evaluated the progression of HF by the non-alcoholic
              fatty liver disease fibrosis score (NFS) based on preoperative
              blood test results, age, body mass index, and diabetes mellitus.
              Patients were grouped according to high (fibrotic liver; FL) or
              low (normal liver; NL) NFS. The influence of HF on hepatic
              recurrence was assessed by survival analyses. RESULTS: A total of
              953 CRC patients were enrolled, comprising 293 in stage I, 327 in
              stage II, and 333 in stage III. The patients included were
              categorised as FL (77) or NL (876). The hepatic recurrence rates
              were 5.3\% in the NL group and 10.4\% in the FL group (P=0.02),
              whereas the overall recurrence rates were 16.0\% in the NL group
              and 20.7\% in the FL group (P=0.03). The 5-year liver-specific
              recurrence-free survival rate in the FL group was significantly
              poorer than that in the NL group (FL 89.1\%, 95\% confidence
              interval (CI) 78.4-94.7 vs NL 96.0\%, 95\% CI 94.3-97.2, log-rank
              test P<0.01). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that HF
              significantly promoted liver-specific recurrence compared with NL
              (HR=2.98, 95\% CI 1.23-7.21; P=0.02). CONCLUSION: HF is a
              valuable prognostic factor for hepatic recurrence after curative
              surgical resection of CRC.",

              worldwide. Thus, the development of new therapeutic targets for
              CRC treatment is urgently needed. SGK1 is involved in various
              cellular activities, and its dysregulation can result in multiple
              cancers. However, little is known about its roles and associated
              molecular mechanisms in CRC. In present study, we found that SGK1
              was highly expressed in tumor tissues compared with peri-tumor
              samples from CRC patients. In vitro experiments revealed that
              SGK1 overexpression promoted colonic tumor cell proliferation and
              migration and inhibited cell apoptosis induced by 5-fluorouracil
              (5-FU), while SGK1 shRNA and inhibitors showed the inverse
              effects. Using CRC xenograft mice models, we demonstrated that
              knockdown or therapeutic inhibition of SGK1 repressed tumor cell
              proliferation and tumor growth. Moreover, SGK1 inhibitors
              increased p27 expression and promoted p27 nuclear accumulation in
              colorectal cancer cells, and p27 siRNAs could attenuate the
              repression of CRC cell proliferation induced by SGK1 inhibitors.
              Collectively, SGK1 promotes colorectal cancer development via
              regulation of CRC cell proliferation, migration and survival.

               factor (TF)-binding sites from ENCODE (Encyclopedia of Genomic
               Elements) in a novel methodology that elucidates regulatory
               contexts associated with cytotoxicity. The method, GENMi (Gene
               Expression iN the Middle), postulates that single-nucleotide
               polymorphisms within TF-binding sites putatively modulate its
               regulatory activity, and the resulting variation in gene
               expression leads to variation in drug response. Analysis of 161
               TFs and 24 treatments revealed 334 significantly associated
               TF--treatment pairs. Investigation of 20 selected pairs yielded
               literature support for 13 of these associations, often from
               studies where perturbation of the TF expression changes drug

              needs systems-level approaches, including network analysis, to

              statistical analysis method that can assess relationships and
              trends in two sets of data. Recently CIA has been used for an
              integrative analysis of multiple high-dimensional omics data.
              However, for classical CIA, all elements in the loading vectors
              are nonzero, presenting a challenge for the interpretation when
              analyzing omics data. For other multivariate statistical methods
              such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA), penalized least
              squares (PLS), various approaches have been proposed to produce
              sparse loading vectors via l1-penalization/constraint. We propose
              a novel CIA method that uses l1-penalization to induce sparsity
              in estimators of loading vectors. Our method simultaneously
              conducts model fitting and variable selection. Also, we propose
              another CIA method that incorporates structure/network
              information such as those from functional genomics, besides using
              sparsity penalty so that one can get biologically meaningful and
              interpretable results. RESULTS: Extensive simulations demonstrate
              that our proposed penalized CIA methods achieve the best or close
              to the best performance compared to the existing CIA method in
              terms of feature selection and recovery of true loading vectors.
              Also, we apply our methods to the integrative analysis of gene
              expression data and protein abundance data from the NCI-60 cancer
              cell lines. Our analysis of the NCI-60 cancer cell line data

              risk for severe COVID-19, within both common and rare variants,
              is particularly enriched in natural killer (NK) cells, which
              places these immune cells upstream in the pathogenesis of severe
              disease. Mendelian randomization indicates that failed
              NKG2D-mediated activation of NK cells leads to critical illness.
              Network analysis further links multiple pathways associated with
              NK cell activation, including type-I-interferon-mediated
              signalling, to severe COVID-19. Our rare variant model, PULSE,
              enables sensitive prediction of severe disease in non-elderly
              patients based on whole-exome sequencing; individualized
              predictions are accurate independent of age and sex, and are
              consistent across multiple populations and cohorts. Risk
              stratification based on exome sequencing has the potential to
              facilitate post-exposure prophylaxis in at-risk individuals,
              potentially based around augmentation of NK cell function.
              Overall, our study characterizes a comprehensive genetic
              landscape of COVID-19 severity and provides novel insights into
              the molecular mechanisms of severe disease, leading to new
              therapeutic targets and sensitive detection of at-risk
              individuals.",

  abstract = "In the era of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and
              personalized medicine, predicting the impact of single nucleotide
              polymorphisms (SNPs) in regulatory elements is an important goal.
              Current approaches to determine the potential of regulatory SNPs
              depend on inadequate knowledge of cell-specific DNA binding
              motifs. Here, we present Sasquatch, a new computational approach
              that uses DNase footprint data to estimate and visualize the
              effects of noncoding variants on transcription factor binding.
              Sasquatch performs a comprehensive k-mer-based analysis of DNase
              footprints to determine any k-mer's potential for protein binding
              in a specific cell type and how this may be changed by sequence
              variants. Therefore, Sasquatch uses an unbiased approach,
              independent of known transcription factor binding sites and
              motifs. Sasquatch only requires a single DNase-seq data set per
              cell type, from any genotype, and produces consistent predictions
              from data generated by different experimental procedures and at
              different sequence depths. Here we demonstrate the effectiveness
              of Sasquatch using previously validated functional SNPs and
              benchmark its performance against existing approaches. Sasquatch
              is available as a versatile webtool incorporating publicly
              available data, including the human ENCODE collection. Thus,
              Sasquatch provides a powerful tool and repository for
              prioritizing likely regulatory SNPs in the noncoding genome.",

              technology has improved the dynamic range of gene expression

              can decrease the sensitivity of detecting DEGs. Thus,
              identification and filtering of these low-expression genes may
              improve DEG detection sensitivity. Using the SEQC benchmark

              promoted CRC cell growth, migration and invasion in vitro and
              tumor growth in vivo. In contrast, inhibition of PIK3CD by
              specific small-interfering RNA or idelalisib dramatically
              suppressed CRC cell growth, migration and invasion in vitro and
              tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, PIK3CD overexpression increased

              multi-omic measurements of the same sample are still challenging
              and current methods have not been well evaluated in terms of
              reproducibility and broad applicability. Here we adapted a
              solvent-based method, widely applied for extracting lipids and
              metabolites, to add proteomics to mass spectrometry-based
              multi-omics measurements. The metabolite, protein, and lipid

              a diverse set of sample types, including cell cultures, microbial
              communities, and tissues. To illustrate the utility of this
              protocol, an integrative multi-omics analysis was performed using
              a lung epithelial cell line infected with Middle East respiratory
              syndrome coronavirus, which showed the impact of this virus on
              the host glycolytic pathway and also suggested a role for lipids

              measurements from diverse sample types (e.g., environmental, in
              vitro, and clinical). IMPORTANCE In systems biology studies, the
              integration of multiple omics measurements (i.e., genomics,
              transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics) has
              been shown to provide a more complete and informative view of
              biological pathways. Thus, the prospect of extracting different
              types of molecules (e.g., DNAs, RNAs, proteins, and metabolites)
              and performing multiple omics measurements on single samples is
              very attractive, but such studies are challenging due to the fact
              that the extraction conditions differ according to the molecule
              type. Here, we adapted an organic solvent-based extraction method

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is the third most frequently
              diagnosed cancer and the third cause of cancer deaths in the
              United States. Despite the fact that tumor cell-intrinsic
              mechanisms controlling colorectal carcinogenesis have been
              identified, novel prognostic and diagnostic tools as well as
              novel therapeutic strategies are still needed to monitor and
              target colon cancer progression. We and others have previously
              shown, using mouse models, that the extracellular matrix (ECM), a
              major component of the tumor microenvironment, is an important
              contributor to tumor progression. In order to identify candidate
              biomarkers, we sought to define ECM signatures of metastatic
              colorectal cancers and their metastases to the liver. METHODS: We
              have used enrichment of extracellular matrix (ECM) from human
              patient samples and proteomics to define the ECM composition of
              primary colon carcinomas and their metastases to liver in
              comparison with normal colon and liver samples. RESULTS: We show
              that robust signatures of ECM proteins characteristic of each
              tissue, normal and malignant, can be defined using relatively
              small samples from small numbers of patients. Comparisons with
              gene expression data from larger cohorts of patients confirm the
              association of subsets of the proteins identified by proteomic
              analysis with tumor progression and metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: The
              ECM protein signatures of metastatic primary colon carcinomas and
              metastases to liver defined in this study, offer promise for
              development of diagnostic and prognostic signatures of metastatic
              potential of colon tumors. The ECM proteins defined here
              represent candidate serological or tissue biomarkers and
              potential targets for imaging of occult metastases and residual
              or recurrent tumors and conceivably for therapies. Furthermore,
              the methods described here can be applied to other tumor types
              and can be used to investigate other questions such as the role
              of ECM in resistance to therapy.",

              amount of data. Genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, interactomics
              are compiled at an ever increasing pace and now form a core part
              of the fundamental systems biology framework. Recently, several
              integrative approaches have been proposed to extract meaningful
              information. However, these approaches lack of visualisation
              outputs to fully unravel the complex associations between
              different biological entities. RESULTS: The multivariate
              statistical approaches 'regularized Canonical Correlation
              Analysis' and 'sparse Partial Least Squares regression' were
              recently developed to integrate two types of highly dimensional
              'omics' data and to select relevant information. Using the
              results of these methods, we propose to revisit few graphical
              outputs to better understand the relationships between two
              'omics' data and to better visualise the correlation structure

              advantageous to increase statistical power in studies where
              logistical considerations restrict sample size or require the
              sequential generation of data. However, significant technical
              heterogeneity is commonly observed across multiple batches of
              data that are generated from different processing or reagent
              batches, experimenters, protocols, or profiling platforms. These
              so-called batch effects often confound true biological
              relationships in the data, reducing the power benefits of
              combining multiple batches, and may even lead to spurious results

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Pathway enrichment techniques are useful for
              understanding experimental metabolomics data. Their purpose is to
              give context to the affected metabolites in terms of the prior
              knowledge contained in metabolic pathways. However, the
              interpretation of a prioritized pathway list is still
              challenging, as pathways show overlap and cross talk effects.
              RESULTS: We introduce FELLA, an R package to perform a
              network-based enrichment of a list of affected metabolites. FELLA
              builds a hierarchical representation of an organism biochemistry
              from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG),
              containing pathways, modules, enzymes, reactions and metabolites.
              In addition to providing a list of pathways, FELLA reports
              intermediate entities (modules, enzymes, reactions) that link the
              input metabolites to them. This sheds light on pathway cross talk
              and potential enzymes or metabolites as targets for the condition
              under study. FELLA has been applied to six public datasets -three
              from Homo sapiens, two from Danio rerio and one from Mus
              musculus- and has reproduced findings from the original studies
              and from independent literature. CONCLUSIONS: The R package FELLA
              offers an innovative enrichment concept starting from a list of
              metabolites, based on a knowledge graph representation of the
              KEGG database that focuses on interpretability. Besides reporting
              a list of pathways, FELLA suggests intermediate entities that are
              of interest per se. Its usefulness has been shown at several
              molecular levels on six public datasets, including human and
              animal models. The user can run the enrichment analysis through a
              simple interactive graphical interface or programmatically. FELLA

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Systematic technical effects-also called batch
              effects-are a considerable challenge when analyzing DNA
              methylation (DNAm) microarray data, because they can lead to
              false results when confounded with the variable of interest.
              Methods to correct these batch effects are error-prone, as
              previous findings have shown. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate how
              using the R function ComBat to correct simulated Infinium
              HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450 K) and Infinium MethylationEPIC
              BeadChip Kit (EPIC) DNAm data can lead to a large number of false
              positive results under certain conditions. We further provide a
              detailed assessment of the consequences for the highly relevant
              problem of p-value inflation with subsequent false positive
              findings after application of the frequently used ComBat method.
              Using ComBat to correct for batch effects in randomly generated
              samples produced alarming numbers of false discovery rate (FDR)
              and Bonferroni-corrected (BF) false positive results in
              unbalanced as well as in balanced sample distributions in terms
              of the relation between the outcome of interest variable and the
              technical position of the sample during the probe measurement.
              Both sample size and number of batch factors (e.g. number of
              chips) were systematically simulated to assess the probability of
              false positive findings. The effect of sample size was simulated
              using n = 48 up to n = 768 randomly generated samples. Increasing
              the number of corrected factors led to an exponential increase in
              the number of false positive signals. Increasing the number of
              samples reduced, but did not completely prevent, this effect.
              CONCLUSIONS: Using the approach described, we demonstrate, that
              using ComBat for batch correction in DNAm data can lead to false
              positive results under certain conditions and sample
              distributions. Our results are thus contrary to previous
              publications, considering a balanced sample distribution as
              unproblematic when using ComBat. We do not claim completeness in
              terms of reporting all technical conditions and possible
              solutions of the occurring problems as we approach the problem
              from a clinician's perspective and not from that of a computer
              scientist. With our approach of simulating data, we provide
              readers with a simple method to assess the probability of false
              positive findings in DNAm microarray data analysis pipelines.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Studies of colorectal cancer (CRC) have shown that
              hundreds to thousands of genes are differentially expressed in
              tumors when compared to normal tissue samples. In this study, we
              evaluate how genes that are differentially expressed in colon
              versus normal tissue influence survival. METHODS: We performed
              RNA-seq on tumor/normal paired samples from 175 colon cancer
              patients. We implemented a cross validation strategy to determine
              genes that were significantly differentially expressed between
              tumor and normal samples. Differentially expressed genes were
              evaluated with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to identify key
              pathways that were de-regulated. A summary differential pathway
              expression score (DPES) was developed to summarize hazard of
              dying while adjusting for age, American Joint Committee on Cancer
              (AJCC) stage, sex, and tumor molecular phenotype, i.e., MSI,
              TP53, KRAS, and CIMP. RESULTS: A total of 1,138 genes were
              up-regulated and 695 were down-regulated. These de-regulated
              genes were enriched for 19 Ingenuity Canonical Pathways, with the
              most significant pathways involving cell signaling and growth. Of
              the enriched pathways, 16 were significantly associated with
              CRC-specific mortality, including 1 metabolic pathway and 15
              signaling pathways. In all instances, having a higher DPES (i.e.,
              more de-regulated genes) was associated with better survival.
              Further assessment showed that individuals diagnosed at AJCC
              Stage 1 had more de-regulated genes than individuals diagnosed at
              AJCC Stage 4. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that having more
              de-regulated pathways is associated with a good prognosis and may

              biological heterogeneity with technical effects. To address this,
              we present a modeling framework for the normalization and
              variance stabilization of molecular count data from scRNA-seq

              observed in clinical practice. While the extent of genetic
              variability in classic pharmacokinetic genes is rather well
              understood, the role of genetic variation in drug targets is
              typically less studied. METHODS: Based on 60,706 human exomes
              from the ExAC dataset, we performed an in-depth computational
              analysis of the prevalence of functional variants in 806
              drug-related genes, including 628 known drug targets. We further
              computed the likelihood of 1236 FDA-approved drugs to be affected
              by functional variants in their targets in the whole ExAC
              population as well as different geographic sub-populations.
              RESULTS: We find that most genetic variants in drug-related genes
              are very rare (f < 0.1\%) and thus will likely not be observed in
              clinical trials. Furthermore, we show that patient risk varies
              for many drugs and with respect to geographic ancestry. A focused
              analysis of oncological drug targets indicates that the
              probability of a patient carrying germline variants in
              oncological drug targets is, at 44\%, high enough to suggest that
              not only somatic alterations but also germline variants carried
              over into the tumor genome could affect the response to
              antineoplastic agents. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that
              even though many variants are very rare and thus likely not
              observed in clinical trials, four in five patients are likely to
              carry a variant with possibly functional effects in a target for

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: It is generally accepted that colorectal cancer (CRC)
              originates from cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are responsible
              for CRC progression, metastasis and therapy resistance. The high
              heterogeneity of CSCs has precluded clinical application of
              CSC-targeting therapy. Here, we aimed to characterize the
              stemness landscapes and screen for certain patients more
              responsive to immunotherapy. METHODS: Twenty-six stem cell gene
              sets were acquired from StemChecker database. Consensus
              clustering algorithm was applied for stemness subtypes
              identification on 1,467 CRC samples from TCGA and GEO databases.
              The differences in prognosis, tumor microenvironment (TME)
              components, therapy responses were evaluated among subtypes.
              Then, the stemness-risk model was constructed by weighted gene
              correlation network analysis (WGCNA), Cox regression and random
              survival forest analyses, and the most important marker was
              experimentally verified. RESULTS: Based on single-sample gene set
              enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) enrichments scores, CRC patients
              were classified into three subtypes (C1, C2 and C3). C3 subtype
              exhibited the worst prognosis, highest macrophages M0 and M2
              infiltrations, immune and stromal scores, and minimum sensitivity
              to immunotherapies, but was more sensitive to drugs like
              Bosutinib, Docetaxel, Elesclomol, Gefitinib, Lenalidomide,
              Methotrexate and Sunitinib. The turquoise module was identified
              by WGCNA that it was most positively correlated with C3 but most
              negatively with C2, and five hub genes in turquoise module were
              identified for stemness model construction. CRC patients with
              higher stemness scores exhibited worse prognosis, more
              immunosuppressive components in TME and lower immunotherapeutic
              responses. Additionally, the model's immunotherapeutic prediction
              efficacy was further confirmed from two immunotherapy cohorts
              (anti-PD-L1 in IMvigor210 cohort and anti-PD-1 in GSE78220
              cohort). Mechanistically, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
              results revealed high stemness score group was enriched in
              interferon gamma response, interferon alpha response, P53

              complement, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and
              IL6-mediated JAK-STAT signaling gene sets. CONCLUSIONS: Our study
              characterized three stemness-related subtypes with distinct
              prognosis and TME patterns in CRC patients, and a 5-gene
              stemness-risk model was constructed by comprehensive
              bioinformatic analyses. We suggest our stemness model has
              prospective clinical implications for prognosis evaluation and

              are increasing up to 25\% in population in global. It remains
              undetermined how much impact liver fibrosis have on the
              development of hepatic metastasis and relapse in colorectal
              cancer (CRC). Hence the aim of this study was to clarify the role
              of liver fibrosis on hepatic metastasis and relapse in CRC
              undergoing curative therapy. METHODS: We enrolled consecutive
              1652 patients with radical colorectal surgery as the discovery
              cohort, and the validation set enrolled 432 CRC patients with
              hepatic metastasis. To determine liver fibrosis, the NFS, FIB4
              and APRI scores were applied. The influence of liver fibrosis on
              hepatic metastasis and relapse was assessed by survival analyses.
              Nomograms with fibrosis score incorporated were established to
              identify the incremental value for individualized relapse
              estimation, which was then assessed with respect to calibration,
              discrimination, and clinical usefulness. RESULTS: The high liver
              fibrosis score patients had significantly worse outcomes than low
              score in 5-year hepatic metastasis (22.6 vs. 8.7\%) in discovery
              cohort, and relapse (58.2 vs. 44.1\%) in validation cohort.
              Multivariate analysis also revealed liver fibrosis as an
              independent prognostic factor. The distribution analysis also
              demonstrated higher liver fibrosis score a powerful prognostic
              factor for hepatic metastasis and relapse. The nomogram
              incorporated with liver fibrosis score resulted in better
              performance than TNM staging system and clinicopathologic
              nomograms. Importantly, the discriminatory capacity of the
              fibrosis score was superior to that of the CRS score in
              predicting hepatic specific disease-free survival (DFS) and
              relapse-free survival (RFS), as demonstrated by the C-index and
              AUC. The concordance study showed well agreement among NFS, FIB4
              and APRI in predicting DFS and RFS. Among these three noninvasive
              liver fibrosis scores, NFS score performed the best in predicting
              hepatic specific DFS and RFS. CONCLUSION: The liver fibrosis was
              a powerful predictor of hepatic specific DFS and RFS in CRC.

              efficiency of drug discovery, which continues along a
              one-drug-one-target-one-disease paradigm. As a partial
              consequence, both the cost to launch a new drug and the attrition
              rate are increasing. Systems pharmacology and pharmacogenomics
              are emerging to exploit the available data and potentially
              reverse this trend, but, as we argue here, more is needed. To
              understand the impact of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental
              factors on drug action, we must study the structural energetics
              and dynamics of molecular interactions in the context of the

              use of ORA in metabolomics, the community lacks guidelines
              detailing its best-practice use. Many factors have a pronounced
              impact on the results, but to date their effects have received
              little systematic attention. Using five publicly available
              datasets, we demonstrated that changes in parameters such as the
              background set, differential metabolite selection methods, and
              pathway database used can result in profoundly different ORA
              results. The use of a non-assay-specific background set, for
              example, resulted in large numbers of false-positive pathways.
              Pathway database choice, evaluated using three of the most
              popular metabolic pathway databases (KEGG, Reactome, and BioCyc),
              led to vastly different results in both the number and function

              metabolomics data, such as the reliability of compound
              identification and the chemical bias of different analytical
              platforms also impacted ORA results. Simulated metabolite
              misidentification rates as low as 4\% resulted in both gain of
              false-positive pathways and loss of truly significant pathways
              across all datasets. Our results have several practical
              implications for ORA users, as well as those using alternative
              pathway analysis methods. We offer a set of recommendations for
              the use of ORA in metabolomics, alongside a set of minimal

              two independent transcriptome datasets, including a total of 137
              CRC and ten normal colonic mucosa samples. Eighty-two gene sets
              as described by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
              database had significantly altered gene expression in both
              datasets. These included networks associated with cell division,
              DNA maintenance, and metabolism. Among signaling pathways with

              network'', comprising part of the PI3K pathway, was found
              deregulated. The downregulated genes in this pathway included
              several members of the Phospholipase C protein family, and the
              reduced expression of two of these, PLCD1 and PLCE1, were
              successfully validated in CRC biopsies (n = 70) and cell lines (n

              methylation of PLCD1 can contribute to reduced expression in 40\%

              CRC in vitro. RESULTS: S100A8 and S100A9 were elevated in more
              than 50\% of CRC tissues and their expression in tumor cells was
              associated with differentiation, Dukes stage and lymph node
              metastasis. The CRC cell lines treatment with recombinant S100A8
              and S100A9 proteins promoted the viability and migration of CRC
              cells. Furthermore, the two recombinant proteins also resulted in
              the increased levels of $\beta$-catenin and its target genes
              c-myc and MMP7. $\beta$-catenin over-expression in CRC cells by
              Ad$\beta$-catenin increased cell viability and migration.
              $\beta$-catenin knock-down by Adsi$\beta$-catenin reduced cell
              viability and migration. Furthermore, $\beta$-catenin knockdown
              also partially abolished the promotive effects of recombinant
              S100A8 and S100A9 proteins on the viability and migration of CRC
              cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our work demonstrated that S100A8 and S100A9
              are linked to the CRC progression, and one of the underlying
              molecular mechanisms is that extracellular S100A8 and S100A9
              proteins contribute to colorectal carcinoma cell survival and
              migration via Wnt/$\beta$-catenin pathway.",

              proportion of this noise. It is therefore mandatory to eliminate
              technical variation while maintaining biological variability.
              Several strategies have been proposed for the removal of batch
              effects, although they have not been evaluated in large-scale
              longitudinal gene expression data. In this study, we aimed at
              identifying a suitable method for batch effect removal in a large
              study of microarray-based longitudinal gene expression. Monocytic
              gene expression was measured in 1092 participants of the
              Gutenberg Health Study at baseline and 5-year follow up.
              Replicates of selected samples were measured at both time points
              to identify technical variability. Deming regression,
              Passing-Bablok regression, linear mixed models, non-linear models
              as well as ReplicateRUV and ComBat were applied to eliminate
              batch effects between replicates. In a second step, quantile
              normalization prior to batch effect correction was performed for
              each method. Technical variation between batches was evaluated by
              principal component analysis. Associations between body mass
              index and transcriptomes were calculated before and after batch
              removal. Results from association analyses were compared to
              evaluate maintenance of biological variability. Quantile
              normalization, separately performed in each batch, combined with
              ComBat successfully reduced batch effects and maintained
              biological variability. ReplicateRUV performed perfectly in the
              replicate data subset of the study, but failed when applied to
              all samples. All other methods did not substantially reduce batch
              effects in the replicate data subset. Quantile normalization plus
              ComBat appears to be a valuable approach for batch correction in
              longitudinal gene expression data.",

              high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data analysis. Although
              there are numerous methods for read count normalization, it
              remains a challenge to choose an optimal method due to multiple
              factors contributing to read count variability that affects the
              overall sensitivity and specificity. In order to properly
              determine the most appropriate normalization methods, it is
              critical to compare the performance and shortcomings of a
              representative set of normalization routines based on different
              dataset characteristics. Therefore, we set out to evaluate the
              performance of the commonly used methods (DESeq, TMM-edgeR,
              FPKM-CuffDiff, TC, Med UQ and FQ) and two new methods we propose:
              Med-pgQ2 and UQ-pgQ2 (per-gene normalization after per-sample
              median or upper-quartile global scaling). Our per-gene
              normalization approach allows for comparisons between conditions
              based on similar count levels. Using the benchmark Microarray
              Quality Control Project (MAQC) and simulated datasets, we
              performed differential gene expression analysis to evaluate these
              methods. When evaluating MAQC2 with two replicates, we observed
              that Med-pgQ2 and UQ-pgQ2 achieved a slightly higher area under
              the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), a specificity
              rate > 85\%, the detection power > 92\% and an actual false
              discovery rate (FDR) under 0.06 given the nominal FDR
              ($\leq$0.05). Although the top commonly used methods (DESeq and
              TMM-edgeR) yield a higher power (>93\%) for MAQC2 data, they
              trade off with a reduced specificity (<70\%) and a slightly
              higher actual FDR than our proposed methods. In addition, the
              results from an analysis based on the qualitative characteristics
              of sample distribution for MAQC2 and human breast cancer datasets
              show that only our gene-wise normalization methods corrected data
              skewed towards lower read counts. However, when we evaluated
              MAQC3 with less variation in five replicates, all methods
              performed similarly. Thus, our proposed Med-pgQ2 and UQ-pgQ2
              methods perform slightly better for differential gene analysis of
              RNA-seq data skewed towards lowly expressed read counts with high
              variation by improving specificity while maintaining a good
              detection power with a control of the nominal FDR level.",

               in understanding how to rank uncertain datasets in recent years.
               In this paper, we address the problem of ranking when the tuple
               scores are uncertain, and the uncertainty is captured using
               continuous probability distributions (e.g. Gaussian
               distributions). We present a comprehensive solution to compute
               the values of a parameterized ranking function (PRF) [18] for
               arbitrary continuous probability distributions (and thus rank
               the uncertain dataset); PRF can be used to simulate or
               approximate many other ranking functions proposed in prior work.
               We develop exact polynomial time algorithms for some continuous

               schemes with provable guarantees for arbitrary probability

              increase in colon cancer cell adhesion and invasion in vitro, and
              metastasis in vivo. In contrast, DPEP1 depletion induced opposite

              with mismatch repair deficiency may also benefit from Immune
              checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). New biomarkers correlated with ICIs
              responsiveness need to be explored. Methods The study data were
              obtained from TCGA, GEO, cBioPortal, UALCAN, UCSC Xena browser,
              and CPTAC databases. Protein kinase C beta (PRKCB) was screened
              via weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA),
              survival analysis and differential expression analysis. The
              biological and immune landscape of PRKCB was explored by
              performing bioinformatics and immunohistochemical analyses. These
              findings were used to predict responsiveness to immunotherapy.
              Results Yellow module in WGCNA, as a hub module, was strongly
              positively correlated with infiltrated CD8 + T cell and Immune
              Score. PRKCB was an essential member of the yellow module,
              downregulated in colon cancer tissue, and associated with poor
              prognosis. GO, KEGG, REACTOME enrichment analysis showed PRKCB
              was associated with Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction,
              Chemokine signaling pathway, T cell receptor signaling pathway,
              NF-$\kappa$B signal pathway, Natural killer cell mediated
              cytotoxicity, and PD-L1 signaling. Meanwhile, the PRKCB
              expression was highly positively correlated with the infiltration
              of the CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, and NK cells. Moreover, the
              immunohistochemistry analysis of tissue microarray demonstrated
              that PRKCB expression was positively correlated with infiltrated
              CD8 + T cell and PD-L1 expression. As expected, the TIDE and
              SubMap algorithm verified that ICIs could be effective in
              PRKCB-high patients. Conclusion PRKCB-high was associated with
              good prognoses in colon cancer patients. PRKCB-high was an
              indicator of inflamed TIME, which correlated with high
              responsiveness to immunotherapy in colon cancer patients.",

              development of CRC diagnostics and therapies. MATERIALS AND
              METHODS: A comparative secretomic analysis was performed using
              primary and metastatic human isogenic CRC cells. Proliferation
              was determined by MTT and thymidine incorporation assay,
              migration was determined by wound-healing assay (ELISA). The

              metastatic cells. Proliferation was suppressed by inhibiting
              expression of NOTUM. Knockdown of NOTUM genes inhibited
              proliferation as well as migration, with possible involvement of

              the biomarkers were further assessed by C-indexes (ranged from

              high-throughput molecular data may contain batch effects, i.e.,
              systematic technical variation. Confounding of experimental
              batches with the variable(s) of interest is especially
              concerning, as a batch effect may then be interpreted as a
              biologically significant finding. An integral step toward
              reducing false discovery in molecular data analysis includes
              inspection for batch effects and accounting for this signal if
              present. In a 30-sample pilot Illumina Infinium
              HumanMethylation450 (450k array) experiment, we identified two
              sources of batch effects: row and chip. Here, we demonstrate two
              approaches taken to process the 450k data in which an R function,
              ComBat, was applied to adjust for the non-biological signal. In
              the ``initial analysis,'' the application of ComBat to an
              unbalanced study design resulted in 9,612 and 19,214 significant
              (FDR < 0.05) DNA methylation differences, despite none present
              prior to correction. Suspicious of this dramatic change, a
              ``revised processing'' included changes to our analysis as well
              as a greater number of samples, and successfully reduced batch
              effects without introducing false signal. Our work supports
              conclusions made by an article previously published in this
              journal: though the ultimate antidote to batch effects is
              thoughtful study design, every DNA methylation microarray
              analysis should inspect, assess and, if necessary, account for
              batch effects. The analysis experience presented here can serve

              proteoglycan family and plays dual roles as an oncogene and a
              tumor suppressor gene. The effect of LUM on tumors is still
              controversial. Methods: Gene expression profiles and clinical
              data of gastric cancer (GC) were downloaded from The Cancer
              Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The expression difference of LUM in
              GC tissues and adjacent nontumor tissues was analyzed by R
              software and verified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain
              reaction (qRT-PCR) and comprehensive meta-analysis. The
              relationship between LUM expression and clinicopathological
              parameters was assessed by chi-square test and logistic
              regression. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional
              hazards regression model were chosen to assess the effect of LUM
              expression on survival. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was
              used to screen the signaling pathways involved in GC between the
              low and the high LUM expression datasets. Results: The expression
              of LUM in GC tissues was significantly higher than that in
              adjacent nontumor tissues (P < 0.001) from the TCGA database.
              qRT-PCR (P = 0.022) and comprehensive meta-analysis (standard
              mean difference = 0.90, 95\% CI: 0.34-1.46) demonstrated that LUM
              was upregulated in GC. The chi-square test showed that the high
              expression of LUM was correlated with tumor differentiation (P =
              0.024) and T stage (P = 0.004). Logistic regression analysis
              showed that high LUM expression was significantly correlated with
              tumor differentiation (OR = 1.543 for poor vs. well or moderate,
              P = 0.043), pathological stage (OR = 3.149 for stage II vs. stage
              I, P = 0.001; OR = 2.505 for stage III vs. stage I, P = 0.007),

              0.001). The Kaplan-Meier curves suggested that patients with high
              LUM expression had a poor prognosis. Multivariate analysis showed
              that a high expression of LUM was an important independent
              predictor of poor overall survival (HR, 1.189; 95\% CI,
              1.011-1.400; P = 0.037). GSEA indicated that 14 signaling

              substantial progress has been made in understanding the basic

              of CRC with high sensitivity and specificity is desirable.
              Metabolomics represents an analytical profiling technique with
              great promise in identifying such biomarkers and typically
              represents a close tie with the phenotype of a specific disease.

              January 2012 to July 2021 relating to the detection of CRC
              biomarkers through metabolomics to provide a collection of

              these metabolite biomarkers, especially dysregulated were certain
              amino acids, fatty acids, and lysophosphatidylcholines.
              Additionally, we discussed the contribution of the gut bacterial

              prognostic significance of fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4)
              were evaluated in two independent cohorts of GC patients.
              Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, diverse mouse models
              and assays for transposase-accessible chromatin with
              high-throughput sequencing were used to investigate the roles and
              mechanisms of action of FABP4. Results: The results of the
              present multicentre study confirmed an association between a
              decrease in the expression of FABP4 and poor outcomes in GC
              patients. FABP4 inhibited GC metastasis but did not influence
              tumour growth in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, FABP4
              binding with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor $\gamma$
              (PPAR-$\gamma$) facilitated the translocation of PPAR-$\gamma$ to
              the nucleus. FABP4 depletion suppressed PPAR-$\gamma$-mediated
              transcription of cell adhesion molecule 3 (CADM3), which
              preferentially governed GC metastasis. Notably, the PPAR-$\gamma$
              agonist rosiglitazone reversed the metastatic properties of
              FABP4-deficient GC cells in vitro and demonstrated viable
              therapeutic potential in multiple mouse models. For GC patients
              with diabetes, low FABP4 portends better prognosis than high
              FABP4 after receipt of rosiglitazone treatment. Additionally,
              chromatin inaccessibility induced by HDAC1 reduced FABP4
              expression at the epigenetic level. Conclusions: Our findings
              suggest that chromatin inaccessibility orchestrates a reduction
              in FABP4 expression, which inhibits CADM3 transcription via
              PPAR-$\gamma$, thereby resulting in GC metastasis. The
              antidiabetic drug rosiglitazone restores PPAR-$\gamma$/CADM3
              activation in FABP4-deficient GC and thus has promising
              therapeutic potential.",

  abstract = "Pheripherin is a 57-kD type III intermediate filament that is a
              specific marker for peripheral neruons, including enteric
              ganglion cells (GCs). Hence antibodies to peripherin may be used
              to demonstrate abnormalities of the enteric nervous system (ENS).
              Serial longitudinal histologic sections of formalin-fixed
              paraffin-embedded colons from 15 patients were immunostained for
              peripherin, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), neurofilaments, S-100,
              and synaptophysin. Ten patients had variable degrees of colonic
              aganglionosis (Hirschsprung's disease), three were premature in
              infants, and two were controls. Peripherin labeling yielded the
              highest number of recognizable GCs. Overall, 56\%, 78\%, and 80\%
              of the peripherin-positive GCs in the myenteric plexus were
              identified by staining for neurofilaments, NSE, and S-100,
              respectively. Intramucosal GCs were detected in 4 of 10 cases of
              Hirschspring's disease (HD), none of which had been evident by
              routine histology. The other neuronal markers were less specific
              for intramucosal GCs than peripherin, because they also added
              enterochromaffin cells. Peripherin immunohistochemistry also
              allowed exact quantification of GC density expressed as GCs/mm
              colon, which is important for the diagnosis of HD-related
              disorders. In three cases of HD the GC density of the transition
              zone was markedly elevated compared with more proximal ganglionic
              bowel segments, consistent with neuronal intestinal dysplasia
              type B, and two cases of HD showed low GC density within the
              transition zone. Hence peripherin immunolabeling may prove to be
              a valuable aid in the diagnosis and classification of congenital
              malformations of the ENS.",
